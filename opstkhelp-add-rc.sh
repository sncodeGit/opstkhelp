### This prog need to add rc-zone in programm local storage
### Functionality:
### 1) Print help : opstkhelp-add-rc -h, --help
### 2) Add rc-zone:  opstkhelp-add-rc RC_FILE
### Other usage should return an error
### Special usage error:
### 1) One argument is a file, but prog can't read it

### [Read pass] -> [Check pass] -> [Read zone name] -> [Check zone name] ->
### [Add zone name to rc-zones] -> [Copy rc-file to local storage]
